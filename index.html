        <strong>Sensitive Content Advisory:</strong>
        The articles selected for annotation may contain sensitive and potentially distressing content.
        Some texts include graphic descriptions of violence, war crimes, and sexual assault.
        We recognize that exposure to such material can be emotionally challenging.
        Annotators are encouraged to prioritize their well-being, therefore if you feel that the content may be too overwhelming or distressing, it is best that you do not participate in this annotation task.

        <h2 id="sec-definitions">Argument Mining Definitions</h2>

        <p>In this section, we provide definitions of the concepts related to this annotation task along with examples to illustrate them.</p>

        <p>Consider Example 1, which presents an argument about the military aid to Ukraine.
        The writer argues whether the international community should increase military aid to Ukraine, providing reasons in favor and against this claim.</p>

        <!-- Example 1 -->
        <div class="example-box" id="ex-argument">
            <b>Example 1.</b>
            <p>While some argue that increased military aid to Ukraine is essential, as it helps them defend their sovereignty against Russian aggression, others caution that such support could lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict.
            Providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, they claim, serves as a deterrent, it discourages further Russian advances.
            However, critics warn that more aid might provoke Russia to retaliate more aggressively, it can potentially draw NATO members into direct conflict.
            Nonetheless, proponents believe that a strong response is necessary because failure to support Ukraine might embolden other authoritarian regimes.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="subsec-EDU">Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs)</h3>
        <p>To identify the different components in an argument we need to divide the text in segments called EDUs.
            An EDU is a self-contained unit of text that conveys a single coherent piece of information.
            EDUs can be a <strong>full sentence or a sentence's clause</strong>.
            That is, an EDU must have a subject and a predicate.
            The predicate must contain a verb.
            For instance, in the sentence "Providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, they claim, serves as a deterrent", the subject is "Providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry" and the predicate is "serves as a deterrent".
            Example 2 delimits the EDUs between square brackets.
        </p>

        <!-- Example 2 -->
        <div class="example-box" id="ex-EDU">
            <strong>Example 2.</strong>
            <p>While some argue that <span class="edu">[increased military aid to Ukraine is essential]</span>, as <span class="edu">[it helps them defend their sovereignty against Russian aggression]</span>, others caution that such <span class="edu">[support could lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict]</span>.
            <span class="edu">[Providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, they claim, serves as a deterrent]</span>, <span class="edu">[it discourages further Russian advances]</span>.
            However, critics warn that <span class="edu">[more aid might provoke Russia to retaliate more aggressively]</span>, <span class="edu">[it can potentially draw NATO members into direct conflict]</span>.
            Nonetheless, proponents believe that <span class="edu">[a strong response is necessary]</span> because <span class="edu">[failure to support Ukraine might embolden other authoritarian regimes]</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        Note that <strong>not all parts of text have to be part of an EDU</strong>.
        Punctuation marks, conjunctions, and transitional words are often excluded since they don't belong to one segment or another.
        This is the case for the words <em>"while", "as", "however", "nonetheless", and "because"</em> in Example 2.
        Also, pieces of text that state indirect speech can be excluded.
        For instance, the phrases <em>"some argue that", "others caution that", and "proponents believe that"</em> are not part of the EDUs in Example 2.
        An exception is the phrase <em>"they claim"</em> in <em>"Providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, they claim, serves as a deterrent"</em>.
        Leaving it out would split the EDU in two parts that do not convey a coherent meaning.
        Another exception arrises when excluding the indirect speech phrase would result in an meaningless EDU.
        In Example 3, the phrase "The Kremlin leader justifies" might be considered indirect speech, but removing it would leave the EDU without a clear subject.
        </p>

        <!-- Example 3 -->
        <div class="example-box" id="ex-segmented-argument">
            <strong>Example 3.</strong>
            <span class="edu">The Kremlin leader justifies his offensive in Ukraine by the desire to "denazify" the country</span>. According to him, <span class="edu">the Russian army comes to free the population from the yoke of the followers of Adolf Hitler who are corrupting both the army and the political sphere</span>.
        </div>


        <h3 id="subsec-argumentcomponents">Argument Components</h3>
        <p>There are two types of components in an argument:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Claim:</strong> A claim is a statement that the speaker or writer wants the audience to accept.</li>
            <li><strong>Premise:</strong> A premise is a reason or piece of evidence that the arguer puts forward to persuade the audience to accept or refute a statement.
            Premises form the basis upon which the conclusion (i.e., claim) is built.
            A premise can correspond to <strong>facts, statistics, quotations, reports, examples, findings, physical evidence, or other reasoning methods</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        In this study EDUs must be annotated as a claim or a premise.
        Therefore a sentence can contain several argument components.
        Claims and premises do not overlap, a piece of text can be annotated as a claim or a premise, but not both at the same time.
        Also, sometimes an EDU does <strong>NOT</strong> present a stance, assertion, or justification related to any argument, in this cases the EDU should <strong>NOT be annotated as a claim or a premise</strong>.
        This is usually the case for the questions posed by the journalist.
        </p>

        <p>Example 4 shows the claims and premises in the argument.</p>

        <!-- Example 4 -->
        <div class="example-box" id="ex-argumentcomponents">
            <strong>Example 4.</strong>
            <span class="claim">Claim</span>
            <span class="premise">Premise</span>
            <p>While some argue that <span class="claim">[increased military aid to Ukraine is essential]</span>, as <span class="premise">[it helps them defend their sovereignty against Russian aggression]</span>, others caution that such <span class="claim">[support could lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict]</span>.
            <span class="premise">[Providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, they claim, serves as a deterrent]</span>, <span class="premise">[it discourages further Russian advances]</span>.
            However, critics warn that <span class="premise">[more aid might provoke Russia to retaliate more aggressively]</span>, <span class="premise">[it can potentially draw NATO members into direct conflict]</span>.
            Nonetheless, proponents believe that <span class="claim">[a strong response is necessary]</span> because <span class="premise">[failure to support Ukraine might embolden other authoritarian regimes]</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        There are indicators that can help to identify claims and premises.
        For instance, claims can be introduced by phrases such as "I believe", "I think", "I am in favor of", "I do not believe", "for this reason", "however", "nonetheless", and "so".
        This is the case of the phrase "<b>Nonetheless</b>, proponents believe that a strong response is necessary" in Example 3.
        Premises can be introduced by phrases such as "because", "for example", "since".
        This is the case of the phrase "a strong response is necessary <b>because</b> failure to support Ukraine might embolden other authoritarian regimes" in the example.
        This is not an exhaustive list, other indicators can be used to identify claims and premises.
        Also, claims and premises can be introduced without any indicator.
        </p>

        <p>
        An argument can contain multiple premises linked to a claim.
        A premise does not exist in isolation, it is always supporting or attacking a claim or premise, while a claim can exist without any premises.
        The claim can appear at the beginning, at the end, or in the middle of the argument.
        For instance, an argument can follow these structures:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Premise, premise, premise, therefore Claim</li>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example 5.</strong>
                <p><span class="premise">The ongoing conflict has resulted in severe civilian casualties</span>, and <span class="premise">has caused international trade disruptions</span>; therefore, <span class="claim">a diplomatic resolution is urgently needed</span>.</p>
            </div>
            <li>Claim because Premise</li>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example 6.</strong>
                <p><span class="claim">Ukraine deserves international support</span> because <span class="premise">it is defending its sovereignty against aggression</span>.</p>
            </div>
            <li>In my judgment, Claim</li>
            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example 7.</strong>
                <p>In my judgment, <span class="claim">further sanctions on Russia will be ineffective at changing its actions in Ukraine</span>.</p>
            </div>

        </ul>

        <p>
        Notice that all claims and premises in the past examples have a subject and a predicate because they must be EDUs.
        The following are examples of text spans that <strong>are not</strong> claims or premises because they are not EDUs:

        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>Example 8</strong>
            <p>The next pieces of text lack a verb, therefore they do not have a predicate and cannot be considered EDUs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The desire to "denazify" countries.</li>
                <li>The Soviet flag: the cherry on top of this propaganda cake.</li>
                <li>A military aid worth £50 million and humanitarian aid worth £16 million.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>Example 9</strong>
            <p>The next pieces of text are not claims or premises because they contain several EDUs. They should be broken down into smaller segments.</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense posted a video on Twitter on Friday, February 25, supposedly showing a Russian plane shot down by Ukrainian forces. These are in fact images from the video game Digital Combat Simulator, as demonstrated by a BBC journalist.</li>

        </div>


        <h3 id="subsec-argumentrelations">Argument Relations</h3>
        <p>Argument relations describe the connections between different elements within an argument or between multiple arguments.
        We consider two main types of argument relations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> A support relation exists between two elements when one element provides evidence, reasons, or justifications for the other element.</li>
            <li><strong>Attack:</strong> An attack relation exists between two elements when one element challenges or contradicts the other element.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Both types of relations can exist between: (i) a premise and another premise, (ii) a premise and a claim, or (iii) a claim and another claim.
        Argument relations have a directionality, where the source component is a reason for or refutation of the target component.
        In this study, we consider that a text segment can have a maximum of one outgoing relation.
        That is, <strong>a segment can support or attack at most one other segment</strong>.
        However, a segment can be supported or attacked by multiple segments.
        When in doubt, the annotator should consider the most relevant relation.
        </p>

        <p>
        A premise does not exist in isolation, it is always supporting or attacking a claim or premise, while a claim can exist without having a relation with other elements.
        </p>

        <p>
        Relations can be stablished between text segments across different paragraphs.
        For instance, a common structural pattern in news writing consists of an introduction, body, and conclusion.
        Typically, argument components presented in the body of the article serve to support or attack the text found in the conclusion.
        Furthermore, the introduction and conclusion paragraphs often contain similar information, reinforcing key ideas.
        As a result, argument components introduced at the beginning of the article could be directly linked to those appearing at the end.
        </p>

        <p>
        In addition, the general argument can be spread across different speakers.
        It is common for journalists to present their own viewpoints while incorporating quotes from experts, public figures, or references to scientific reports.
        These elements can be linked regardless of the speaker.
        Another common scenario is the reporting of interviews, where argument components introduced by the interviewer and the interviewee may support or attack each other.
        </p>

        <p>
        The next figure shows the relations between claims and premises in the argument.
        Notice that C1 is supported or attacked by many other segments.
        However, all segments only support or attack at most one other segment.
        </p>

        <h2 id="sec-text_genres">Text genres and their argumentative structure</h2>

        <p>News articles can take various forms, each with distinct argumentative patterns.
            Here we outline some common types of news articles that you may encounter in this annotation task.
            Understanding these genres can help you better identify and interpret argumentative components within the text.
            Note that this list is not exhaustive, and genres often overlap, that is, a single article can incorporate elements from multiple genres.
            At the end of guidelines we provide examples of each genre.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Classic News Reporting:</strong> This genre focuses on delivering factual information about recent events. As a result, these articles are less likely to contain argumentative components. When annotating, focus on identifying factual claims and premises that support them.
                <a href="#ex-france24">Example 11</a> provides a case of this genre with a strong argumentative structure, while <a href="#ex-franceculture_newsreporting">Example 14</a> is a more straightforward example of classic news reporting. </li>
            <li><strong>Analysis of Commentary:</strong>These articles offer interpretations of events, provide deeper insights, or express opinions. They are rich in argumentative components and often reflect the author's perspective on the issue. There are two main variants:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrastive (Two-sided):</strong> It presents arguments from multiple sides of an issue, allowing for support and attack relations between claims. For example, a piece might present Russia's viewpoint on the conflict, followed by an analysis of Ukraine's perspective, with the author drawing connections or highlighting contradictions. <a href="#ex-argumentcomponents"> Example 4</a> is an instance of this genre.</li>
                <li><strong>Viewpoint (One-sided):</strong>It presents only one perspective, focusing on the support relations. The author will likely provide reasoning and evidence to back up the main claims, but the article will not contain many counterarguments or attack relations. <a href="#ex-lerubicon">Example 13</a> illustrates this genre.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Interview:</strong> The text is typically structured in a question-answer format. The questions rarely contain argument components, as they are not assertions nor do they provide pieces of evidence related to other parts of the text. However, answers provided by the interviewee often contain claims and premises. These answers may also present supporting or opposing arguments, particularly when discussing controversial or complex topics. <a href="#ex-radiofrance">Example 10</a> is an instance of this genre.</li>
            <li><strong>Narrative (Experiences):</strong> This type of writing tends to focus on storytelling rather than argumentation. As a result, it rarely contains claims or premises. However, narratives can serve as a source of evidence or examples for a claim. <a href="#ex-franceculture_narrative">Example 14</a> is an instance of this genre.</li>
            <li><strong>Speeches:</strong> Speeches, whether political or ceremonial, are designed to persuade or inform an audience. They are often rich in support relations. Sometimes speeches also engage with opposing views, for instance when the speaker quotes an opponent's argument to refute it. In these texts, look for clear claims and the reasoning that supports them, often tied to a particular goal or agenda. <a href="#ex-legrandcontinent">Example 12</a> illustrates this genre.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2 id="sec-annotation-process">Annotation Process</h2>

        <p>
        For each annotation task, the annotator will be presented with a segment of text from a news article.
        Follow the steps below in strict order to ensure a consistent annotation process:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Familiarize with the text:</b> Begin by reading each paragraph in its entirety before identifying claims and premises. </li>
            <li><b>Annotate Claims:</b> After reading the paragraph, identify and annotate any claims.</li>
            <li><b>Annotate Premises:</b> Proceed to identify and annotate premises.</li>
            <li><b>Annotate Premises' Relations:</b> Link premises <strong>to claims or other premises</strong> within the same paragraph or in other paragraphs, assigning each link as either a support or attack relation.</li>
            <li><b>Annotate Claim's Relations:</b> Link claims <strong>to other claims</strong> within the same paragraph or in other paragraphs, assigning each link as either a support or attack relation.
            <b>Not</b> all claims need to be linked to other elements. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <b>Remember:</b> Each segment annotated as claim or premise should independently convey a meaning.
        The segment can be a full sentence or a clause.
        That is, it must have a subject and a predicate.
        If the segment does not present a stance, assertion, or justification related to any argument, it should <b>not</b> be annotated as a claim or a premise.
        A paragraph could contain only claims, only premises, or a mix of both.
        An argument component can support or attack <strong>at most</strong> one other argument component.
        </p>

            <p>The construction of the Ukrainian nation.</p>

            <p>Is Ukraine as a fictitious nation a new rhetorical theme for Vladimir Putin?</p>

            <p><span class="claim">[It is not a new theme]</span>. <span class="claim">[Vladimir Putin has already sought to reconstruct Ukrainian history and present us with a very biased interpretation of this country]</span>. <span class="claim">[Any discourse on the history of national construction necessarily justifies the goals of the present]</span>. Ioulia Shukan</p>

            <p><span class="premise">[Russian propaganda is spreading a map where Ukraine is reduced to a small central region]</span>. What about this construction of the Ukrainian nation?</p>

            <p><span class="premise">[To return to the history of Ukrainian national construction, this map does not mention the period of the early years of 1917-1918 when an independent Ukrainian state, the Ukrainian People's Republic, was proclaimed in March 1918]</span>. Faced with <span class="premise">[the creation of this new state entity, which relied on both an intellectual and political tradition, and the effort to reconstruct a modern Ukrainian language from dialects, the Bolsheviks were also forced to create their own Ukrainian language from dialects, the Bolsheviks were also forced to create their own Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]</span>. (...) <span class="premise">[Throughout these years of civil war, the borders were shifting]</span>. <span class="premise">[There were other territorial changes before and after the Second World War]</span>. <span class="claim">[All Soviet states, including Russia, are the product of these historical events]</span>. <span class="claim">[Vladimir Putin wants to deny this]</span>. Ioulia Shukan</p>

        <p>
        Notice that the first sentence "La construction de la nation ukrainienne" does not independently convey meaning, therefore it cannot be considered a claim or a premise.
        Also, the second sentence is a question which conveys meaning by itself, however it does not present a stance, assertion, or justification related to any argument.
        </p>

        In the next figure, notice that in this case there are no attacks.
        Also, there are 2 structures: one contains C4, P3, P4, and P5, and the other contains the rest of the claims and premises.

        Example 11 is a case of <em>classic news reporting</em>. The next figure shows the relations between claims and premises in the argument.

            <p><b>Text genre: Speech.</b></p>

            <p>So I'll start with the fact that <span class="claim">[modern Ukraine was created entirely by Russia, or to be more precise by Bolshevik, communist Russia]</span>. <span class="premise">[This process started right after the 1917 revolution]</span>. <span class="premise">[Lenin and his comrades did this in a very painful way for Russia]</span>, <span class="premise">[by separating, tearing away lands that are historically Russian]</span>. <span class="premise">[Nobody asked the opinion of the millions of people who lived there]</span>.</p>

        </div>

        <p> This example contains an extract of a speech by Vladimir Putin.
        Speeches are usually rich in argument components, and they mostly rely on support relations.
        See the argumentation structure of Example 12 in the next figure.</p>

            <p><b>Text genre: Analysis or commentary.</b></p>

            <p>In his best-selling book The Black Swan, Lebanese-American essayist and statistician <span class="premise">[Nassim Nicholas Taleb warns us about our interpretive and confirmation biases, which naturally lead us to focus on pre-selected segments of what we see and generalize them to what we do not see]</span>.</p>

            <p>To illustrate this, <span class="premise">[Taleb tells the story of Diagoras, known as the Atheist, named after a Greek lawgiver, lyric poet, and sophist of the fifth century BCE]</span>. <span class="claim">[When Diagoras was shown painted tablets depicting devout people who had prayed and survived a shipwreck]</span>, <span class="claim">[Diagoras argued against the hasty conclusion that prayer had saved them]</span>. Instead, <span class="premise">[he wondered where the portraits of those who had prayed but died anyway were]</span>.</p>

            <p>At a time when the air war is still raging in Ukraine and continues to surprise Western air experts with its unfolding, <span class="claim">[it is essential to remain sensitive to the Diagoras problem: what we see does not necessarily reflect what we do not see]</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <p> Note that, overall, Example 13 can be considered an article of the genre of <em>analysis or commentary</em>.
        However, the second paragraph corresponds to a <em>narrative</em>.
        This is an example of how different text genres can be present in the same article.
        Also, it shows how narratives can be used to support claims and premises in an argumentative context.
        See its argument relations in the next figure.</p>

            <p>It is an external situation that is imposed, that comes from nowhere. And me, in this situation, I had the possibility to leave. I left Kiev a little before the start of the war, on the instructions of our Norwegian embassy, but I could not leave the country. I could not leave Ukraine to its own devices. Without any value judgment on my friends, especially foreign ones, who left. But personally, I could not do it and I stayed in Ukraine.</p>

        <p>Examples 14 and 15 do not contain any argumentative structures.
        Therefore these examples do not contain any annotations.
        Example 14 simply presents facts which could be used as premises in an argument, but they are not used as such in this case.
        Premises cannot exist in isolation, that is, they must be used to support or attack other components of the argument.
        Similarly, Example 15 is a narrative which states a sequence of events without making any assertion.</p>
